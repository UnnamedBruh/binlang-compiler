		<h1>BINLang (Revised)</h1>
		<p>The BINLang language is now revised (the creator thought about the programming language again). Now it has more efficient compilation techniques, and it allows way more types than it did before.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions, here is the list of questions that are frequently asked (FAQ):</p>
		<h2>Why use BINLang?</h2>
		<p>BINLang takes up a lot less storage compared to traditional program files, mainly because of it's binary architecture, and how it's programs are compressed. It also has a faster speed execution, since interpreters for the program file don't have to lex, or parse the file; they could instead interpret the file directly, reducing overhead of the program.</p>
		<h2>Do I have to use BINLang?</h2>
		<p>No, you don't have to use BINLang if this programming language is not required for your projects.</p>
		<h2>Which programming language does BINLang run on?</h2>
		<p>BINLang generally runs on JavaScript for the compilation, and a <a href="//lua.org">Lua</a> version of the compiler may be available in the near future.</p>
		<h2>Can I switch to BINLang right now?</h2>
		<p>You most certainly can switch to BINLang right now! But again, you don't have to if you don't want to.</p>
		<h2>Why was BINLang introduced?</h2>
		<p>BINLang was introduced to help reduce the amount of storage space needed. Having 3000 bytes for a program that just logs six messages - takes up an unnecessary amount of space, and can add up a lot of storage consumption. So that's why BINLang is introduced into the internet.</p>
		<h2>How is a BINLang program compressed?</h2>
		<p>The BINLang compiler compresses identifiers into a unique, single byte (unless the identifier is having it's value changed later), which is more efficient than packing each identifier.</p>
		<h2>When was BINLang re-introduced?</h2>
		<p>BINLang was re-introduced at the following date: 10/22/2024.</p>
		<h2>Where can I learn BINLang?</h2>
		<p>You can learn BINLang <a href="/binlang-compiler/web/tutorial2.html">here</a>!</p>
		<h2>How come the creator re-introduced BINLang?</h2>
		<p>The creator felt that he couldn't exactly work with the old version. So, he decided to re-think the language's syntax, and add a static-typed system instead of a dynamic-typed system.</p>
