<h1>Defining Variables</h1>
<p>The first iconic command ever, is to define a variable. It's the most important, and one of the oldest commands, ever. You can define a variable by using the <code>SET</code> operator. Here are important things to know:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The identifier can <u>only</u> be represented with UPPERCASE, lowercase, and underscore (_) characters.</li>
	<li>In the legacy version, variables can only be represented using an integer. In this version, you have to specify which type the value is, due to the now <u>static-typed</u> environment.</li>
	<li>The value would represent a value that fits the provided type under other rules:<ul>
		<li>UINT8:<ul>
			<li><a style="background-color: yellow">This value is an unsigned integer. It doesn't need to represent whether the value is negative or not.</a></li>
			<li>The value can be represented between 0 - 255. If a value is provided beyond this range, the value will automatically be clamped into that range.</li>
			<li>The value can only be represented using numbers. Attempting to use a decimal will <b>floor</b> the value.</li>
			<li>The value takes up <b>one byte</b> per defined type, which is due to the value only needing eight bits (e.g. <a style="background-color: yellow">8 bits = 1 byte</a>).</li>
			<li><u>You can use this value for when you want to represent a player's level, or the game's difficulty.</u></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>UINT16:<ul>
			<li><a style="background-color: yellow">This value is an unsigned integer, like UINT8. It doesn't need to represent whether the value is negative or not.</a></li>
			<li>The value can be represented between 0 - 65536. If a value is provided beyond this range, the value will automatically be clamped into that range, like UINT8.</li>
			<li>The value can only be represented using numbers. Attempting to use a decimal will <b>floor</b> the value, like UINT8.</li>
			<li>The value takes up <b>two bytes</b> per defined type, which is due to the value only needing sixteen bits.</li>
			<li><u>You can use this value for when you want to represent the player's current XP (eXperience Points), or the player's current health/maximum health.</u></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>INT8:<ul>
			<li><a style="background-color: yellow">This value is a signed integer. It shows whether the value is negative or not.</a></li>
			<li>The value can be represented between -128 - 127. If a value is provided beyond this range, the value will automatically be clamped into that range, like UINT8.</li>
			<li>The value can only be represented using numbers. Attempting to use a decimal will <b>floor</b> the value, like UINT8.</li>
			<li>The value takes up <b>one byte</b> per defined type, which is due to the value only needing eight bits (e.g. <a style="background-color: yellow">8 bits = 1 byte</a>), like UINT8.</li>
			<li><u>You can use this value for when you want to represent a simple number for mathematical equations, or the player's walking direction (if implemented in a specific way).</u></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>UFLOAT16:<ul>
			<li><a style="background-color: yellow">This value is an unsigned float. It does not show whether the value is negative or not.</a></li>
			<li>The value can be represented between 0 - 255.99609375. If a value is provided beyond this range, the value will automatically be clamped into that range, like UINT8.</li>
			<li>The value can only be represented using numbers, and periods, like how this sentence is ended by. However, the compiler handles this in a unique way. Using a decimal will <b>round</b> the decimal to the nearest 0.00390625th, unlike how similar compilers would handle this.</li>
			<li>The value takes up <b>two bytes</b> per defined type, which is due to the value only needing sixteen bits (e.g. <a style="background-color: yellow">16 bits = 2 bytes</a>), like UINT16.</li>
			<li><u>You can use this value for when you want to represent an enemy's health, or when you want to represent a position of a paddle (like in <i>Pong: The Classic Arcade Game</i>).</u></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>UTF8STRING:<ul>
			<li><a style="background-color: yellow">This value is a <u>parameter-based</u> type, which isn't a very common feature. A single parameter is needed, and the parameter is placed before the value. The parameter would make the compiler interpret the value in three different ways, depending on the parameter.</a></li>
			<li>The value can be represented at <u>any length</u> - there are no constraints, or any limit to the length of the string.</li>
			<li>The string uses the UTF8 encoding format, which makes it so the string can represent <b>256</b> unique characters.</li>
			<li>The value takes up <b>one byte</b> per character, which the measuring can be dependent on how many characters are used in the string.</li>
			<li><u>You can use this value for when you want to script a game dialogue, or a tutorial message of how to play the game.</u></li>
			<li>The string value will throw an error if there is a character beyond the 256 character range. <s>UTF16STRING will be a type that will later come in the future.</s> (it was added 10/27/2024)</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>BOOLEAN:<ul>
			<li><a>This value is very simple; it represents two values - <code>TRUE</code>, or <code>FALSE</code>.</a></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>UTF16STRING:<ul>
			<li><a style="background-color: yellow">This value is also a <u>parameter-based</u> type, which isn't a very common feature. A single parameter is needed, and the parameter is placed before the value. The parameter would make the compiler interpret the value in three different ways, depending on the parameter, like UTF8STRING.</a></li>
			<li>The value can be represented at <u>any length</u> - there are no constraints, or any limit to the length of the string.</li>
			<li>The string uses the UTF16 encoding format, which makes it so the string can represent <b>65536</b> unique characters.</li>
			<li>The value takes up <b>two bytes</b> per character, which the measuring can be dependent on how many characters are used in the string.</li>
			<li><u>You can use this value for when you would want to make messages compatible in different languages.</u></li>
		</ul></li>
