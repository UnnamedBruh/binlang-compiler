		<h1>BINLang</h1>
		<p>This is an online website that allows you to compile the program code into binary files for faster execution, compared to traditional interpreters.</p>
		<textarea id="program" placeholder="You can write your BINLang program code here..."></textarea>

		<h2>Why use BINLang?</h2>
		<p>BINLang takes up less storage compared to traditional program files, mainly because of it's binary architecture. It also has a faster speed execution, since interpreters for the program file don't have to lex, or parse the file; they could instead interpret the file directly, reducing overhead of the program.</p>
		<h2>Do I have to use BINLang?</h2>
		<p>No, you don't have to use BINLang if this programming language is not required for your projects.</p>
