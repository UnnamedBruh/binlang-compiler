<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>Ah, the first ever version of BINLang - it's as good as new! The nostalgia - it reminds me of the good old times... wait. What were we at again? Oh yes, the BINLang compiler! The way to define a variable using BINLang is to use the <code>DEF</code> keyword. This keyword typically uses the following structure: <code>DEF &lt;identifier&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;identifier&gt;</code> template represents the identifier that would get treated as a variable later on in the program. Variables can be <a href="/binlang-compiler/web/tutorial-rem.html">unloaded</a> once they don't need to be used anymore.</p>
<p>This is how to define a variable:</p>
<div style="background-color: black">
	<a style="color: gray">DEF</a> <a>variable</a><br>
	<a style="color: gray">DEF</a> <a>AppleBanana</a><br>
	<a style="color: gray">DEF</a> <a>camelCase</a>
</div>
<p>This is how <u style="color: red">NOT</u> to define a variable:</p>
<div style="background-color: black">
	<a style="color: gray">DEF</a> <a>vari4ble123</a><br>
	<a style="color: gray">DEF</a><br>
	<a style="color: gray">DEF</a> <a>h&lloTh%r#</a>
</div>
<p>If you learnt how to define a variable by looking at the examples, then good for you! You did an excellent job.</p>
